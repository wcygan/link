# Design Principles

1. The application should be *easy* to run locally & test (I can test new features quickly)
2. The build & deploy steps should be *quick* (waiting seconds, not minutes)
3. The application should be *maintainable* (easy to understand, easy to change)
4. It should be possible (and easy) to deploy the application to any Kubernetes cluster (my friends should be able to easily run it on their cluster)
5. The web frontend should be reachable over the internet (my friends should be able to access it on their devices)
